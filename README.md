# Music-Genre-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
This code is for a project at ASU. Using raw audio data categorized into 10 different genres, I trained convolutional neural networks to classify between the classes. I used 1-D and 2-D CNNs for this purpose and did a sort of comparison as to what works better for this. To my surprise, 1-D CNN won on this one!
